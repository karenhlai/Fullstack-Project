        <p>
          We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog
          and put whatever they <br />want on it. Stories, photos, GIFs, TV
          shows, links, quips, dumb jokes, smart jokes, <br />Spotify
          tracks, mp3s, videos, fashion, art, deep stuff. Trendr is
          466 million different <br />blogs, filled with literally whatever.
